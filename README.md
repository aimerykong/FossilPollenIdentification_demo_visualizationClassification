This folder contains demo codes for generating exemplar patch candidates in training dictionary, 
how to do viewpoint aligment, and the whole classification pipeline.

The libsvm toolbox is required. Please compile it on your PC before running the code.

The dataset is too large that github does not allow me to upload. A link will be added soon to download the dataset.

Please stay tuned.
