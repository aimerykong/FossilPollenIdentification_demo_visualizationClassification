# Matching Patches for Pollen Identification through Spatially-aware Dictionary Learning and Coding

[project page](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~skong2/recurrentDepthSeg)

This folder contains demo codes for generating exemplar patch candidates in training dictionary, 
how to do viewpoint aligment, and the whole classification pipeline for our project with the following published paper.

The libsvm toolbox is required. Please compile it under ``libs'' directory before running the code.

The dataset is large; to download the dataset, 
please go [google drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxeylfSgpk1Mdk1HeVhaaEdxMEk&usp=sharing).
To run the demos, please put the downloaded folder under proper directory (refer to addpath in the script).
Note that the fossilized pollen grains are not released for now. Please stay tuned.
